Lab: Async

- We're refactoring the Web API we have so far to support asynchronous operations. That way it can handle more concurrent requests.
- We start with PersonRepository. Make the AddPerson method async and let it return a Task<PersonDto> (or whatever type you have as a DTO)
- Instead of calling SaveChanges on the dbContext object, call SaveChangesAsync. This returns a Task.
- Await the call to SaveChangesAsync.

- Make GetPerson async as well using the same trick. The method call to await is _Context.Persons.SingleOrDefaultAsync (instead of SingleOrDefault)
- Same for GetPersons. The way to do it here is to first retrieve the persons and then do the Select:
	var persons = await _Context.Persons.ToArrayAsync();
	persons.Select(p => ...
- Adjust the IPersonRepository interface.

- In the PersonController now make all actions return a Task<IActionResult> and make them async.
- await all calls to the repository.

- Run and see if it works.
